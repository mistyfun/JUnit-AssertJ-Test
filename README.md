# Todo List Application

This is a simple Java application that implements a todo list, and uses [AssertJ](https://assertj.github.io/doc/) and [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) to test the implementation.

## Files

The project has the following files:

- `src/main/java/org/example/Todo.java`: The main class that implements the todo item.
- `src/main/java/org/example/TodoList.java`: The class that implements the todo list.
- `src/test/java/org/example/TodoListTest.java`: The test class that tests the `TodoList` implementation using AssertJ and JUnit.
- `src/test/java/org/example/ExampleTest.java`: A test class that tests basic Java classes to demonstrate different technologies used.

## Testing

The `TodoListTest` class contains test cases that ensure the todo list implementation behaves as expected. The tests use AssertJ to perform assertions, and JUnit to run the tests.

## Example Test

The `ExampleTest` class is a simple test class that tests basic Java classes to demonstrate different technologies used. This test class is not related to the todo list implementation, but just something I made to play around with JUnit and AssertJ.
